# Secure Untrusted Data Repository (SUNDR)

This repository aims at implementing [SUNDR](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/osdi04/tech/full_papers/li_j/li_j.pdf).

The original idea comes from the the [MIT 6.858 final project](https://github.com/mit-pdos/secfs-skeleton). I will reuse some code from this project.
